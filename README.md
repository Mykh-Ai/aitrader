# Стратегія Ші v1.0 — AI Trader

BTC research and analysis system built toward algorithmic trading.
Currently at Phase 2: raw data collection + Analyzer facts engine + setup research pipeline.
Target execution: Binance Spot Margin BTC/USDC (isolated, max 2x) — planned Phase 4.

**Trading hypothesis:** Liquidity grab + failed break reclaim. Price sweeps a structural
swing level (collecting stops), then reclaims back. If the reclaim is confirmed by volume
spike + delta divergence — this is a mean-reversion entry after liquidity, not momentum.
Failed break is the first implemented setup type; additional types are planned.

## Project Status

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1. Raw feed + Analyzer facts engine | ✅ Implemented | 1m collector live; Analyzer computes all features and events |
| 2. Setup research pipeline | ✅ Implemented | Setup extraction, outcomes, reports, context analysis, rankings, selections, shortlist, explanations, final research summary |
| 3. Backtesting | 🔜 Planned | 6-month strategy validation |
| 4. Execution | 🔜 Planned | Live trading via Binance Spot Margin API |

## Analyzer — Scope

The Analyzer is a **facts engine + research pipeline**. It:

- Computes derived features and metrics from raw 1m feed
- Detects and normalizes structural events (swings, sweeps, failed breaks)
- Extracts and enriches setup candidates (currently from failed-break events; additional setup types planned)
- Computes forward-looking outcome metrics (MFE, MAE, close return)
- Builds grouped research reports and context-bucketed statistics
- Ranks setup groups against an overall baseline
- Classifies ranked groups into research candidate selections (SELECT/REVIEW/REJECT)
- Exports a deterministic shortlist of top candidates for review
- Generates structured shortlist explanations with categorical bands and composite codes
- Builds a deterministic final research summary surface from shortlist outputs

All output is **research-only**. The Analyzer does **not**:

- Open trades or generate live entry signals
- Size positions or place orders
- Perform strategy optimization or ruleset selection
- Perform backtesting (this belongs to Phase 3)
- Act as executor or interface with the exchange

The selection, shortlist, and explanation layers are research triage tools —
they surface candidates for human review, not automated trade decisions.

## Analyzer — Module Architecture

Package: `analyzer/`

**Phase 1 — Facts engine:**

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `schema.py` | Schema contracts: required raw input columns, numeric coercion contract, implemented/planned feature registry, `EVENT_COLUMNS`, and validation helpers/errors |
| `loader.py` | Load and validate raw aggregator CSV: parse UTC timestamps, enforce required columns, coerce numerics, normalize `IsSynthetic`, reject duplicates |
| `base_metrics.py` | Compute per-bar derived metrics: Delta, CVD, DeltaPct, BarRange, BodySize, UpperWick, LowerWick, CloseLocation, BodyToRange, wick ratios, OI_Change, LiqTotal |
| `swings.py` | Detect H1/H4 structural fractal swings with confirmation delay; annotate feature table with `SwingHigh_*_Price`, `SwingHigh_*_ConfirmedAt`, `SwingLow_*` columns |
| `sweeps.py` | Detect H1/H4 sweeps of confirmed swing levels on 1m bars; annotate `Sweep_*_Up`, `Sweep_*_Down`, direction, reference level/timestamp |
| `failed_breaks.py` | Detect H1/H4 failed-break events: track bars-since-sweep forward in time; annotate `FailedBreak_*_Up`, `FailedBreak_*_Down`, confirmed timestamp |
| `absorption.py` | Compute deterministic rolling-ratio context features: `RelVolume_20`, `DeltaAbsRatio_20`, `OIChangeAbsRatio_20`, `LiqTotalRatio_20`, context spike booleans, `AbsorptionScore_v1` |
| `events.py` | Build normalized event table from materialized feature columns; emits `SWING_HIGH`, `SWING_LOW`, `SWEEP_UP`, `SWEEP_DOWN`, `FAILED_BREAK_UP`, `FAILED_BREAK_DOWN` |

**Phase 2 — Setup research pipeline:**

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `setups.py` | Extract setup candidates from `FAILED_BREAK_UP/DOWN` events; enrich with context snapshot from feature row; annotate lifecycle (PENDING/INVALIDATED/EXPIRED) over 12-bar TTL |
| `outcomes.py` | Compute forward-looking outcome metrics per setup over 12-bar horizon: MFE_Pct, MAE_Pct, CloseReturn_Pct, BestHigh, BestLow, FinalClose |
| `reports.py` | Aggregate setup/outcome statistics grouped by: overall, SetupType, Direction, LifecycleStatus, OutcomeStatus |
| `context_reports.py` | Aggregate statistics by context flag families (binary) and numeric feature tertile buckets (LOW/MID/HIGH) |
| `rankings.py` | Score and rank setup groups against overall baseline; label each group as TOP/NEUTRAL/WEAK/LOW_SAMPLE |
| `selections.py` | Classify ranked groups into SELECT/REVIEW/REJECT decisions with deterministic threshold logic; research triage only |
| `shortlists.py` | Filter to SELECT+REVIEW rows, sort by priority and score, assign ShortlistRank; export/review view only |
| `shortlist_explanations.py` | Derive categorical bands (ScoreBand, SampleBand, DeltaDirection, PositiveRateDirection) and composite ExplanationCode per shortlist row |
| `research_summary.py` | Build deterministic final research summary rows from shortlist + shortlist explanations; map research priority and enforce strict one-to-one joins |

**Infrastructure:**

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| `io.py` | Output helpers: ensure output directory exists, save DataFrames to CSV |
| `pipeline.py` | Orchestration entrypoint: wires the full layer sequence and saves all artifacts |

### Data lineage

```
raw CSV → features (one row per 1m bar)
features → events (structural events)
features + events → setups (setup candidates from failed breaks — first implemented type)
features + setups → outcomes (forward metrics: MFE, MAE, CloseReturn)
setups + outcomes → report (grouped stats)
setups + outcomes → context_report (bucketed stats)
report + context_report → rankings (scored vs baseline)
rankings → selections (SELECT/REVIEW/REJECT)
rankings + selections → shortlist (top candidates ranked)
shortlist → shortlist_explanations (categorical bands + code)
shortlist + shortlist_explanations → research_summary (final surface)
```

### Tests

`tests/` contains one test file per analyzer module:

```

```

`tests/fixtures/` holds minimal CSV files used as shared test inputs:

```
tests/fixtures/
├── sample_raw_minimal.csv
├── sample_raw_with_gap.csv
└── sample_raw_with_synthetic.csv
```

`docs/Spec_v1.0.md` is the normative Analyzer contract. Tests are written against the spec.

### Structural safety guards

### Structural swing detection

Swing detection is performed on a structure-only subset of the dataset:

```python
structure_df = df[df["IsSynthetic"] == 0]
```

Only real (traded) rows participate in structural analysis. Synthetic rows
(`IsSynthetic == 1`) remain in the dataset for continuity and rolling metrics,
but cannot define market structure, trigger sweeps, or confirm failed breaks.

Confirmed swing levels are attached back to the full dataframe so that
downstream layers can access them.

### First-visibility materialization

`ConfirmedAt` is the semantic structural confirmation time. In the full
dataframe, confirmed swing state is first materialized on the first real
row with `Timestamp >= ConfirmedAt`.

Combined with synthetic-bar exclusion and TF completeness thresholds, this
closes three classes of structural contamination:

- **Synthetic contamination** — synthetic rows cannot define or confirm structure
- **Sparse TF bucket contamination** — incomplete H1/H4 bars are excluded entirely
- **First-visibility drift** — swing state appears only at the first real row after confirmation

### Timeframe completeness policy

Resampled H1 and H4 bars must meet minimum real-row completeness thresholds
before they are eligible for swing detection:

```python
MIN_REAL_BARS_H1 = 45   # out of 60 possible 1m rows
MIN_REAL_BARS_H4 = 180  # out of 240 possible 1m rows
```

Incomplete bars cannot serve as swing center, left neighbor, right neighbor,
or confirmation source. This fail-closed policy prevents sparse data buckets
or ingestion artifacts from generating false structural events.

### Gap safety policy

Stateful logic (such as failed-break confirmation) is protected from large
timestamp discontinuities.

If the time difference between consecutive rows exceeds:

```python
MAX_STATE_GAP_MINUTES = 3
```

the internal pending state is reset.

This is a fail-closed safety mechanism designed to prevent structural
misinterpretation after:

- reconnects
- packet loss
- data gaps
- delayed ingestion

### Research note

The value of `MAX_STATE_GAP_MINUTES` is currently a conservative safety choice.
It may be adjusted after sufficient dataset collection and empirical analysis.

The goal at this stage is structural data integrity rather than maximal
event capture.

## Phase 1: Aggregator

### Raw feed schema (1m candles)

| Column | Source | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Timestamp | system | UTC bar open time |
| Open, High, Low, Close | aggTrade WS | OHLCV prices |
| Volume | aggTrade WS | Total volume |
| AggTrades | aggTrade WS | Number of Binance aggTrade messages (not individual fills) |
| BuyQty | aggTrade WS | Taker buy volume (for delta) |
| SellQty | aggTrade WS | Taker sell volume (for delta) |
| VWAP | aggTrade WS | 1m volume-weighted average traded price |
| OpenInterest | REST /fapi/v1/openInterest | Open interest snapshot (BTC) |
| FundingRate | markPrice WS | Funding rate |
| LiqBuyQty | forceOrder WS | Short liquidation volume |
| LiqSellQty | forceOrder WS | Long liquidation volume |
| IsSynthetic | system | 1 = synthetic candle (no trades in interval) |

### Data notes

**AggTrades** counts Binance aggTrade messages, not individual exchange fills. BuyQty / SellQty are accurate for delta and CVD. AggTrades should not be interpreted as true fill count.

**Synthetic candles** — when no trades occur during a 1m interval, the collector writes a synthetic candle using the last known price (mark price or last trade). Marked `IsSynthetic=1`. Analyzer modules may exclude these when computing compression or volatility features.

**Liquidation data** — derived from the `forceOrder` stream. Observed liquidation events; not a guaranteed complete record of all market liquidations. Intended for contextual analysis.

**BuyQty / SellQty** — taker-aggressor volume. They indicate which side initiated market orders but do not by themselves indicate directional control. Always combine with price response (close location, wick structure, range behavior).

**VWAP** — `sum(price * qty) / sum(qty)` per bar. Falls back to Close on synthetic candles.

### Storage

CSV by day: `feed/YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

### WebSocket streams

- `btcusdt@aggTrade` — trades
- `btcusdt@forceOrder` — liquidations
- `btcusdt@markPrice@1s` — funding rate, mark price

### REST endpoints

- `GET /fapi/v1/openInterest?symbol=BTCUSDT` — OI snapshot once per minute

## Running

### Collector — Docker (production)

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker logs -f shi-aggregator
```

### Collector — Local (dev)

```bash
pip install websocket-client requests
python binance_aggregator_shi.py
```

Output: `feed/YYYY-MM-DD.csv` — one file per UTC day.

### Analyzer pipeline

```python
from analyzer.pipeline import run

result = run("feed/2024-03-15.csv", output_dir="output/")

```

### Analyzer — daily operational run

At the current project stage, Analyzer is intended to run as a separate daily cron job.
Aggregator continuously writes raw UTC-day CSV files to `feed/YYYY-MM-DD.csv`.
Analyzer should run once per day after UTC rollover and process yesterday's completed UTC file.

Example: at `2026-03-14 00:05 UTC`, Analyzer input should be `feed/2026-03-13.csv`.

Cron is the default operational path for the current phase.
Manual Analyzer runs are only for development, debugging, validation, or troubleshooting.

Minimum recommended pre-run checks:

- yesterday raw CSV exists
- today's new UTC CSV already exists
- yesterday file is non-empty
- yesterday file contains the expected CSV header
- target analyzer run directory is unique

These are operational recommendations for the current runtime mode, not claims about already enforced code-level checks unless documented elsewhere.
A future continuously running container/service mode is possible later, but it is outside the current scope and is not the current deployment contract.

Requires `pandas`. Tests: `pytest tests/`.
